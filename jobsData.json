      "job_description": "Who we are\n\nAbout Stripe\n\nStripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nThe Privacy Infrastructure team creates tools and systems that help Stripe meet our privacy obligations, protect our customer's data, and ensure it is used responsibly. We build the core tooling and infrastructure that allows Stripe to programmatically track the data we store, determine what policies apply to that data, and automatically enforce access control and deletion policies based on the business purpose and sensitivity of the data.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nWe’re looking for an infrastructure-focused engineer to help build the core systems that we use to power Stripe's access control and data deletion systems. In this role you will design, build, and drive adoption of tools that create strong security invariants for the protection of our users’ data. You will have the opportunity to build abstractions, frameworks and libraries that allow developers to focus on their job while security and compliance is done correctly for them behind the scenes.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nDesign, build, and maintain core infrastructure frameworks, services and APIs used by all of Stripe’s engineering teams.\n• Collaborate with stakeholders across security, legal, and compliance teams to encode best practices for data protection into how products and infrastructure are built.\n• Support other engineering teams in integrating Security and Privacy tooling.\n• Design and refine tooling to create a great developer experience for other Stripes.\n• Uphold our high engineering standards and improve our codebase and processes.\n• Design and build systems that advance the Stripe's Infrastructure beyond the state of the art.\n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n• 1.5+ years of software development experience.\n• Experience independently designing and developing mid-size projects.\n• Experience writing high quality code in a major programming language\n• Ability to drive clear next steps when working in an ambiguous environment.\n• Ability to think creatively and reason clearly in a complex problem domain\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Experience developing, deploying, and maintaining reliable infrastructure systems.\n• Security or Privacy experience is a plus but not a requirement.\n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nA remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual US base salary range for this role is $150,500 - $225,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nAdditional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",

The CKP offers a variety of opportunities to express the uniqueness within each city and to implement a local model to promote its Knowledge Keepers.\n\nThe CKP is composed of websites, apps, and virtual-reality environments that engage visitors in a simulated, expanded, and extended experience, guide visitors in the city’s spaces, and allow them to retain memory of the activities even after a visit.\n\nThe CKP component is now available as the TRusTTM App (search for “trusttm” in the App Store or Google Play). It supports communities of artisans and farmers in leveraging their unique Traditional and Creative Knowledge to reach one of the objectives set by the United Nations 2030 Agenda, Goal 8, “To promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”.\n\nFor more details:\n\nITKI US: itkius.org/\n\nTRusTTM: trusttm.com/en/\n\nTech Gap Italia: en.techgap.it/\n\nJob Description\n\nThe Role:\n\nWe are currently looking for candidates to join our Software Development Team in Tucson.
